# Solid Auth Expo

**Open-source SDK to enable [Solid](https://solidproject.org) (OIDC) authentication in Expo / React Native apps**, with optional integration into [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/).  

This project is being developed as part of a proposal to the [NGI Zero Commons Fund](https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund/), with the aim of expanding Solid adoption into the mobile ecosystem and giving end-users full control over their personal data.

## âœ¨ Goals

- Provide a simple SDK for integrating **Solid login** into Expo apps.  
- Support **OIDC flow with PKCE** and secure token storage on iOS/Android.  
- Offer **optional integration with Supabase** for backend compatibility.  
- Deliver full **documentation, tutorials, and demo apps** to make adoption easy.  
- Release under a **permissive open-source license (MIT)** so any developer or project can reuse it.

## ðŸš€ Roadmap (MVP)

1. **Core Solid login flow** in Expo (OIDC + PKCE + DPoP).  
2. **Profile data retrieval** (WebID, name, avatar).  
3. **Supabase integration**: map Solid identities to Supabase Auth.  
4. **Documentation & examples**: tutorials, sample apps, community feedback.

## ðŸ”— Related Project: WeShare

This SDK will be piloted within **[WeShare](https://www.weshareapp.eu)**, a collaborative economy mobile app that allows users to lend, rent, and share items in their community.  

By integrating Solid, WeShare explores how **users can own their data** and decide how their identity and activity are shared across apps in the solidarity economy.
