# Solid Auth Expo

**Open-source SDK to enable [Solid](https://solidproject.org) (OIDC) authentication in Expo / React Native apps**, with optional integration into [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/).  

This project is being developed as part of a proposal to the [NGI Zero Commons Fund](https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund/), with the aim of expanding Solid adoption into the mobile ecosystem and giving end-users full control over their personal data.

---

## ✨ Goals

- Provide a simple SDK for integrating **Solid login** into Expo apps.  
- Support **OIDC flow with PKCE** and secure token storage on iOS/Android.  
- Offer **optional integration with Supabase** for backend compatibility.  
- Deliver full **documentation, tutorials, and demo apps** to make adoption easy.  
- Release under a **permissive open-source license (MIT)** so any developer or project can reuse it.

## 🌍 About Solid

[Solid](https://solidproject.org/) is a web decentralization project led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.  

Solid enables individuals to store their data in **Personal Online Data stores (PODs)** and decide which apps and services can access it. Instead of companies owning user data, Solid gives control back to the people, improving privacy, interoperability, and trust.  

This SDK aims to bring **Solid’s vision of personal data sovereignty** to the **mobile ecosystem**, starting with Expo and React Native developers.

## 🚀 Roadmap (MVP)

1. **Core Solid login flow** in Expo (OIDC + PKCE + DPoP).  
2. **Profile data retrieval** (WebID, name, avatar).  
3. **Supabase integration**: map Solid identities to Supabase Auth.  
4. **Documentation & examples**: tutorials, sample apps, community feedback.

## 🔗 Related Project: WeShare

This SDK will be piloted within **[WeShare](https://www.weshareapp.eu)**, a collaborative economy mobile app that allows users to lend, rent, and share items in their community.  

By integrating Solid, WeShare explores how **users can own their data** and decide how their identity and activity are shared across apps in the solidarity economy.
